; SendP2PPacket() send types
; Typically k_EP2PSendUnreliable is what you want for UDP-like packets, k_EP2PSendReliable for TCP-like packets
#enum EP2PSend! [
	; Basic UDP send. Packets can't be bigger than 1200 bytes (your typical MTU size). Can be lost, or arrive out of order (rare).
	; The sending API does have some knowledge of the underlying connection, so if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or
	; there is a recognized adjustment happening on the connection, the packet will be batched until the connection is open again.
	k_EP2PSendUnreliable: 0

	; As above, but if the underlying p2p connection isn't yet established the packet will just be thrown away. Using this on the first
	; packet sent to a remote host almost guarantees the packet will be dropped.
	; This is only really useful for kinds of data that should never buffer up, i.e. voice payload packets
	k_EP2PSendUnreliableNoDelay: 1

	; Reliable message send. Can send up to 1MB of data in a single message. 
	; Does fragmentation/re-assembly of messages under the hood, as well as a sliding window for efficient sends of large chunks of data. 
	k_EP2PSendReliable: 2

	; As above, but applies the Nagle algorithm to the send - sends will accumulate 
	; until the current MTU size (typically ~1200 bytes, but can change) or ~200ms has passed (Nagle algorithm). 
	; Useful if you want to send a set of smaller messages but have the coalesced into a single packet
	; Since the reliable stream is all ordered, you can do several small message sends with k_EP2PSendReliableWithBuffering and then
	; do a normal k_EP2PSendReliable to force all the buffered data to be sent.
	k_EP2PSendReliableWithBuffering: 3
